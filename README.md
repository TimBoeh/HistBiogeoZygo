# Historical assembly of Zygophyllaceae in the Atacama Desert
The Atacama Desert harbors a unique arid-adapted flora with a high degree of endemism, but the origin of this flora is poorly understood. In the Atacama Desert, Zygophyllaceae is represented by five endemic species: one member of Zygophylloideae: *Fagonia chilensis*; and four members of Larreoideae: *Bulnesia chilensis* and *Porlieria chilensis*,the only representatives in the Atacama Desert of genera with disjunct distributions between Argentina, Peru and Chile; and monotypic endemic genera *Metharme lanataand* and *Pintoa chilensis*.

In this study I used chloroplast sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Zygophyllaceae and used Dispersal-Exteinction-cladogeneses model implemented in BioGeoBears in order to reconstruct the ancestral area of the Zygophyllaceae in the Atacama Desert. Here make the r-skript I worte for the analyses as well as to plot the trees.
