# Historical assembly of Zygophyllaceae in the Atacama Desert
The Atacama Desert harbors a unique arid-adapted flora with a high degree of endemism, the origin of which is poorly understood. In the Atacama Desert, Zygophyllaceae is represented by five endemic species: one member of Zygophylloideae: *Fagonia chilensis*; and four members of Larreoideae: *Bulnesia chilensis* and *Porlieria chilensis*,the only representatives in the Atacama Desert of genera with disjunct distributions between Argentina, Peru and Chile; and monotypic endemic genera *Metharme lanataand* and *Pintoa chilensis*.
