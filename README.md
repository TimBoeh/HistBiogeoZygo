# Historical assembly of Zygophyllaceae in the Atacama Desert
The Atacama Desert harbors a unique arid-adapted flora with a high degree of endemism, but the origin of this flora is poorly understood. In the Atacama Desert, Zygophyllaceae is represented by five endemic species: one member of Zygophylloideae: *Fagonia chilensis*; and four members of Larreoideae: *Bulnesia chilensis* and *Porlieria chilensis*, the only representatives in the Atacama Desert of genera with disjunct distributions between Argentina, Peru and Chile; and monotypic endemic genera *Metharme lanata* and *Pintoa chilensis*.

In this study I used chloroplast sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Zygophyllaceae and used Dispersal-Exteinction-cladogeneses model implemented in BioGeoBears in order to reconstruct the ancestral area of the Zygophyllaceae in the Atacama Desert. 

This repository only exists to make the R script I worte for the ancestral area reconstruction (using `BioGeoBEARS`) as well as the tree plotting (using `phyloch` among other packages) publically available.

Sequences generated for this study are available on GenBank. Please see supplementary material availabel on the journal homepage for further information. However, the final nexus files I compiled and used in this study are availabel on the [CRC1211 Database](https://www.crc1211db.uni-koeln.de/data.php?dataID=304). If the code I wrote made a conciderable contribution to your own work or if you used the data sets I made available please concider to cite the original paper and/or the data publication:
